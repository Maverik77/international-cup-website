IMPORTANT: Email Confirmation Setup Required

Before deploying, you need to:

1. Decide which email address to send confirmations from:
   - Option A: Your personal email (e.g., erikwagner77@gmail.com)
   - Option B: A custom domain email (e.g., noreply@lansdowne-international-cup.com)

2. Verify the email address with AWS SES:
   ./setup-ses-email.sh YOUR_EMAIL_HERE

3. Check your inbox and click the verification link

4. Then deploy with:
   sam deploy ... --parameter-overrides SenderEmail=YOUR_EMAIL_HERE

For now, I'll deploy without triggering the email setup script.
You can verify an email and redeploy when ready.
