# Quick News Deployment Guide

## Overview
The `deploy-news.sh` script allows you to quickly deploy news updates to your live website without waiting for GitHub Actions. This is perfect for urgent news updates or quick content changes.

## Usage

### 1. Edit your news
Edit the `data/news.json` file with your new content.

### 2. Run the deployment script
```bash
./deploy-news.sh
```

### 3. Confirm deployment
The script will show you the current content and ask for confirmation before deploying.

## What the Script Does

1. **Validates** that `data/news.json` exists
2. **Shows** you the current content before deploying
3. **Uploads** the file to S3 bucket: `international-cup-website-1757115851`
4. **Invalidates** CloudFront cache for immediate updates
5. **Confirms** successful deployment

## Features

- âœ… **Safety first**: Shows content and asks for confirmation
- âœ… **Error handling**: Checks for AWS CLI and file existence
- âœ… **Colored output**: Easy to read status messages
- âœ… **Fast deployment**: Bypasses GitHub Actions for quick updates
- âœ… **Cache invalidation**: Changes appear immediately (1-2 minutes)

## Requirements

- AWS CLI installed and configured
