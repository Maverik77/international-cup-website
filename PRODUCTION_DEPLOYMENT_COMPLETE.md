### Deployment Status
- ✅ Staging branch: Up to date and deployed to `staging.lansdowne-international-cup.com`
- ✅ Main branch: Merged and pushed
- 🔄 GitHub Actions: Currently deploying to production
- ✅ Production URL: `www.lansdowne-international-cup.com`

## Environment Isolation

### Production
- **URL**: https://www.lansdowne-international-cup.com
- **Backend**: Separate DynamoDB tables (`*-prod`)
- **API**: `https://qzq9gvuk9f.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod`
- **Data**: Fresh/empty (ready for actual event)

### Staging
- **URL**: https://staging.lansdowne-international-cup.com
- **Backend**: Separate DynamoDB tables (original names)
- **API**: `https://35taqw9rrk.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod`
- **Data**: Can be used for testing without affecting production

## Next Steps (Required)

### 1. Verify Production Deployment
Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Actions to complete, then check:
```bash
# Check GitHub Actions status
open https://github.com/Maverik77/international-cup-website/actions
```

### 2. Initialize Production Data
Once deployment completes:

1. **Access Production Admin Panel**:
   - Go to: `https://www.lansdowne-international-cup.com/pairings/admin.html`
   - Login with password: `icup2024`

2. **Load Team Rosters**:
   - Click "Load Sample Data" button
   - This will populate all 48 players (24 USA + 24 International)
   - Click "Save Roster" to persist to production database

3. **Initialize Pairings Structure**:
   - Click "Initialize Empty Pairings"
   - This creates 36 empty matches:
     - 12 team matches (Day 1)
     - 24 singles matches (Day 2)
   - Pairings remain unassigned until you're ready

### 3. Test Production System
1. **Test Admin Panel**:
   - Verify players loaded correctly
   - Test creating a sample pairing
   - Test saving a pairing
   - Test reveal functionality

2. **Test Display Page**:
   - Open: `https://www.lansdowne-international-cup.com/pairings/display.html`
   - Verify WebSocket connection (should show "Connected")
   - Test reveal from admin panel
   - Confirm display updates in real-time

3. **Test Homepage**:
   - Open: `https://www.lansdowne-international-cup.com`
   - Click "View Roster" for both teams
   - Verify all 48 players are visible
   - Check tee color badges (⚪) appear correctly

## CloudFormation Outputs

```
REST API URL: https://qzq9gvuk9f.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod
WebSocket URL: wss://kgzjvhxu6l.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod
Pairings Table: icup-pairings-prod
Players Table: icup-players-prod
Reveal State Table: icup-reveal-state-prod
WebSocket Table: icup-websocket-connections-prod
```

## Troubleshooting

### If GitHub Actions Fails
1. Check the Actions tab: https://github.com/Maverik77/international-cup-website/actions
2. Review error logs
3. Verify GitHub secrets are configured:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - `AWS_REGION`
   - `S3_BUCKET_NAME`
   - `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`

### If Admin Panel Won't Load Players
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoints in the page source match the deployment
3. Test API directly:
   ```bash
   curl https://qzq9gvuk9f.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/players
   ```

### If Display Page Won't Connect
1. Check WebSocket URL in browser console
2. Verify WebSocket endpoint:
   ```bash
   wscat -c wss://kgzjvhxu6l.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod
   ```

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Revert main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```
2. GitHub Actions will auto-deploy previous version
3. Production backend remains but won't be used
4. Staging remains unaffected

## Cost Impact

Additional AWS costs for production:
- DynamoDB Tables: ~$0 (on-demand pricing, minimal usage)
- Lambda Functions: ~$0 (free tier covers this usage)
- API Gateway: ~$0 (free tier for low usage)
- **Total estimated cost**: <$1/month

## Files Modified

Infrastructure:
- `pairings-infrastructure.yaml` - Added Environment parameter
- `lambda/**/*.js` - Updated to use environment variables

Frontend:
- `pairings/admin.html` - Updated to production API endpoints
- `pairings/display.html` - Updated to production API endpoints
- `index.html` - Added team roster section

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check CloudWatch logs for Lambda errors
2. Review GitHub Actions deployment logs
3. Verify CloudFront cache is invalidated (may take 5-10 minutes)
4. Test with hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) to bypass browser cache
