# Pairing System Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## üéâ What Was Built

A complete overhaul of the International Cup Pairings Reveal System with player roster management, flexible two-step reveals, and responsive display capabilities.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Backend (AWS Serverless)

#### New DynamoDB Table
- **`icup-players`** - Stores player roster with names, nicknames, and tee colors

#### New Lambda Functions
1. **`GetPlayersFunction`** - `GET /players`
   - Fetches all players from roster
   - Public access (no auth required)
   
2. **`UpdatePlayersFunction`** - `POST /players`
   - Updates entire player roster
   - Password-protected (`X-Admin-Password` header)
   
3. **`RevealPairingFunction`** - `POST /reveal`
   - Replaces old `RevealNextFunction`
   - Supports two-step reveal process (`step: 1` or `step: 2`)
   - Accepts `pairingId` for specific match control
   - Supports `revealOrder` (usa-first / intl-first)
   - Broadcasts to WebSocket clients

#### Updated Data Models

**Player Object:**
```json
{
  "id": "player-usa-1",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "nickname": "Johnny",
  "team": "USA",
  "teeColor": "Blue"
}
```

**Pairing Object (enhanced):**
```json
{
  "id": "day1-team-1",
  "type": "team",
  "day": 1,
  "match_number": 1,
  "usa_team": {
    "player1_id": "player-usa-1",
    "player2_id": "player-usa-2"
  },
  "intl_team": {
    "player1_id": "player-intl-1",
    "player2_id": "player-intl-2"
  },
  "revealOrder": "usa-first",
  "revealStep": 0
}
```

**WebSocket Message:**
```json
{
  "type": "reveal",
  "pairingId": "day1-team-1",
  "step": 1,
  "side": "usa",
  "pairing": {...}
}
```

### Frontend - Admin Panel (`pairings/admin.html`)

#### Player Roster Management
- **Two-column layout**: USA vs International
- **Add/Edit/Delete players**
- **Player fields**:
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Nickname (optional)
  - Tee Color (Blue/White dropdown)
- **Load Sample Data** button for testing
- **Save Roster** button to persist to DynamoDB

#### Enhanced Pairing Editor
- **Player dropdowns** instead of text inputs
- Displays: "First Last (Nickname)" or "First Last"
- **Per-match reveal order** radio buttons
- **Per-match reveal buttons**:
  - "Reveal First Side" (step 1)
  - "Reveal Second Side" (step 2)
- **Status indicators**:
  - Not Started (gray)
  - Side 1 Revealed (orange)
  - Both Revealed (green)

#### Removed Features
- Global "Reveal Next" button (replaced with per-match control)
- Text input fields for player names (replaced with dropdowns)

### Frontend - Display Screen (`pairings/display.html`)

#### Player Name Resolution
- Fetches player roster on load
- Resolves player IDs to display names
- Shows nicknames when available

#### Two-Step Animation System
- **Step 1**: Shows only first side
  - Large animated box (60px/100px padding, 3.5rem font)
  - Team color (red or navy)
  - Stays on screen until step 2
- **Step 2**: Shows second side
  - Second team appears next to first
  - Both hold for 3 seconds
  - Smooth transition to grid

#### Responsive Layout
- Uses `clamp()` for all font sizes
- Auto-scales based on viewport
- All matches fit without scrolling
- Only shows fully revealed matches (`revealStep === 2`)

### CSS Updates (`css/pairings.css`)

#### Responsive Sizing
```css
/* Dynamic font scaling */
font-size: clamp(0.8rem, 1.1vw, 1.3rem);
padding: clamp(8px, 1vh, 12px);
```

#### Larger Animations
- Reveal boxes: 60px/100px padding (was 40px/60px)
- Font size: 3.5rem (was 2.5rem)
- Player names: 2.8rem (was 2rem)
- Animation: 1.2s (was 0.8s)

#### New Styles
- Player roster management UI
- Reveal order controls
- Reveal status indicators
- Per-match reveal buttons
